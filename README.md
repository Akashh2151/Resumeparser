Resume Parser Using SpaCy 3
This project leverages SpaCy 3 and a dataset of 1,000 annotated PDF resumes to develop a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model aimed at efficiently parsing resumes. This tool is designed to automatically extract key information from resumes, aiding in streamlined data processing and analysis.

Features
SpaCy 3 Integration: Utilizes the powerful capabilities of SpaCy 3 for high accuracy in entity recognition.
Large Dataset: Trained on a diverse dataset of 1,000 annotated resumes, ensuring robustness and reliability across various resume formats.
Automated Parsing: Automatically extracts essential data from resumes, such as contact information, skills, education, and work experience.
